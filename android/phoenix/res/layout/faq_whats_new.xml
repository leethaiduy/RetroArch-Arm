        * (RGUI) Added sophisticated shader stacking - for Cg shaders.\n

        * (Libretro/RGUI) Add Core Options. This makes it possible to 'expose' options for a libretro
        core to the frontend.\n
        * (Libretro) Add SET_SUPPORT_NO_GAME to API.\n
        * (RGUI) Change menu layout options.\n

        * [PCSX ReARMed] Add core options 'NEON enhanced resolution' and 'NEON enhanced resolution speedhack' - this is for systems with ARM NEON CPUs. Note that this will easily triple or even quadruple CPU requirements. If you have an underpowered CPU, you might want to try this out in combination with the 'Frameskip' option (setting it higher than 0) to make things somewhat playable.\n
        * [Genesis Plus GX] Latest compatibility updates from ekeeke (main author)\n
        * [Genesis Plus GX] Add Core Options for blargg NTSC, Overscan and Game Gear Extend Screen\n

\n
        r12 (Feb 16, 2013)\n\n

into the same folder as the FDS ROM you're trying to load. For everyone else -
put disksys.rom into your system directory.\n
  - Y Button will switch sides of a disk.\n
  - If you get any problems of the sort DISK A / B ERR 07' - pressing Y button again or letting it run its course should do it.\n
  - NOTE - Famicom Disk System loading is slow, so you might be tempted to fast forward through most of it. However, I'd advise caution when doing so and to savestate regularly in case 'fast forwarding' can negatively affect disk loading.\n
* [FBA core] Various changes/fixes\n

        * Nestopia core - use mono sound like the real NES.\n
        * Genesis Plus GX - Lunar Eternal Blue (JP) works again.\n
        \n
        r8 (Jan 30, 2013) - VERSION 0.9.8.1\n\n

        \n
